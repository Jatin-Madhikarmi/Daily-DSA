Compared to the previous Binary_Tree.c instead of using initializeTree() and insertLeft() and insertRight() we can't create a perfect Binary Search Tree(BST) since we are force fully adding the elements i.e in the Binary Tree the left side contains all the elements lesser than the root node. Here we have selected the root node's value to be 10 i.e in the left part of the tree we have all the elements having the value lesser than the root node's value and in the right hand side we have the values greater or equals to the root node's value but in this we are inserting 9 which is less than 10(root node's value) so it is wrong so we have an insert() which properly inserts the value according to the tree.
